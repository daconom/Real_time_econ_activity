# Daily Economic Activity
The aim of this project is to develop a real time indicator for economic activity.

## Motivation
To slow down the spread of the SARS Covid-19 pandemic, governments around the world introduced restrictive measures. As of writing (31.03.2020), around a [quarter of the world population](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/nearly-20-of-global-population-under-coronavirus-lockdown) is under a lockdown. This has wide ranging effects on the economy.

## Marine traffic
Port.py is scraping maritime traffic.

## Vehicle Traffic

## To do
* real time pollution in major industrial hubs
* creation of *heat map*
* website port 

## Discussion
* Inclusion of night light pollution
* Building of LSTM Network to make predictions
