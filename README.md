The aim of this project is to collect real time data on economic activity.

## Motivation

As of writing (31.03.2020), around a [quarter of the world population](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/nearly-20-of-global-population-under-coronavirus-lockdown) is under a lockdown. This has wide ranging effects on the economy.
